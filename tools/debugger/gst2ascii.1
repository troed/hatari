.SH "NAME"
gst2ascii \- Filter and output Atari program symbol table as ASCII
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gst2ascii
.RI  [options]
.RI  <program>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIgst2ascii\fP reads (GNU-style a.out or traditional DRI/GST) symbol
table from given Atari program and outputs it in the ASCII format
understood by Hatari debugger and its profiler data post-processor
(latter doesn't accept any other format).
.PP
All symbol addresses output by the tool are TEXT relative, so
when loading them in Hatari debugger, one needs to give just TEXT
as offset for the 'symbols' command.
.PP
There are some options for filtering the symbol table content, and
the resulting ASCII output is easy to edit also by hand, in case other
symbols (e.g. loop labels) need to be removed from it, or missing
function symbols need to be added to it.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fP
Filter absolute (= value, not address) symbols out from the output.
.TP
\fB-b\fP
Filter BSS symbols out from the output.
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Filter DATA symbols out from the output.
.TP
\fB-t\fP
Filter TEXT symbols out from the output.
.TP
\fB-l\fP
Filter local (.L*) symbols out.  Usually they're useless because
they don't have names, just numbers.
.TP
\fB-o\fP
Filter symbols for object files (*.o) out.
.TP
\fB-n\fP
Sort symbol output by symbol name, not by their addresses.
.SH "NOTES"
If you have problems, try with 'nm -n <program>' instead
(Atari or cross-compiler version). If \fInm\fP works,
but \fIgst2ascii\fP doesn't, please report a bug on it.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Save 'program.prg' symbol table in ASCII format with
local symbols filtered out:
.br
	gst2ascii -l program.prg > program.sym
.PP
Load generated ASCII symbols file in Hatari debugger:
.br
	symbols program.sym TEXT DATA BSS
